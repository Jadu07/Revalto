### 2. Problem Statement

Let's be real: college life is expensive, and we're constantly buying and selling stuff. First-years need mini-fridges and textbooks; final-years need to get rid of them.

Right now, our options are terrible. We use:

* **Messy Facebook Groups:** There's no search, no categories, and you get buried in "is this available?" comments. It's pure chaos.
* **General Marketplaces (like OLX or eBay):** These are built for the whole world. They're full of strangers, potential scams, and you have to deal with shipping. Itâ€™s not built for a closed campus community.

The problem is a lack of a **trusted, centralized, and easy-to-use** platform for students at our college to trade with each other.

### 3. Proposed Solution

We are building **CampusConnect Marketplace**, a hyper-local marketplace exclusively for students at our college.

Think of it as an "eBay for our campus." Our solution is a simple web platform where students can:

1.  **Sign up securely** using their official college (`.edu`) email address. This builds instant trust.
2.  **Easily list items** for sale in clean categories (Textbooks, Electronics, Dorm Furniture, Notes/Supplies, etc.).
3.  **Anonymousity**A seller's identity remains **anonymous** to the public.
4.  **Search, filter, and browse** listings from other students.
5.  **Purchase an item:** A buyer (whose identity *is* visible to the seller) pays securely through the platform, the payment is refudable in case they don't agree for sell or buy during campus meet.
6.  **Connect directly** with sellers to arrange a (safe) campus meetup for the final exchange and product check.


This model protects sellers from pranks or social awkwardness while ensuring buyers are serious because a payment has been made.

### 4. Target Audience

Our target audience is *every* student at our college, but we have two main user groups:

* **The Seller:** Typically, second- to final-year students who have items they no longer need (last semester's textbooks, Earphones that they don't use now, a guitar they don't play, other items). Their goal is to refurbish and make some quick cash.
* **The Buyer:** Typically, first- and second-year students (or any student on a budget). They need required items but want to save money. Their goal is to find a good deal from a trusted source (another student).

### 5. Market Research & Existing Alternatives

Our core innovation isn't a new technology; it's **community-based trust combined with seller privacy**. The college email verification is the key.

| Alternative | The Problem with It | Our Advantage (Why We're Better) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Online "Free & For Sale" Groups** | Chaotic, no search, no filters, full of spam. | **Structure:** We're a proper marketplace with search, categories, and filtering. |
| **OLX / eBay / General Sites** | Too broad, risk of scams from strangers, hassle of shipping. | **Trust & Hyper-local:** We're *only* our college. Everyone is verified. All exchanges are on campus. |
| **Word of Mouth / Posters** | Inefficient, slow, and relies on pure luck. | **Efficiency:** A 24/7 digital hub where everyone can see everything. |

### 6. Implementation Plan

* **Tech Stack & Strategy:** We'll use an Agile approach with 2-week "sprints." Our technical implementation will use:
    * **Version Control:** **GitHub** (with a main branch and feature branches)
    * **Frontend:** **React** (using **Vite** for a fast build process)
    * **Backend:** **Node.js** and **Express.js**
    * **Database:** A **non-relational database** (like MongoDB) or maybe a **relational database** (PostgreSQL (using Prisma as an ORM)) depending on necessity
    * **API Client:** **Axios** (for frontend-backend communication)
    * **Payment Gateway:** **Razorpay** or **Stripe** (to handle transactions securely)
    * **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend) & Render (Backend)

* **Roles:**
    * `Yash Sharma`: Project Lead & UI/UX Design (Figma)
    * `Yashraj Chauhan`: Frontend Lead (React, CSS, API integration)
    * `Rohan Kumar` & `Kundan Gupta`: **Backend Team**. Co-responsible for all server-side logic, including:
        * API Development (Node.js, Express)
        * Database Management (MongoDB)
        * User Authentication
        * Image Uploads (Cloudinary) & Deployment
* **Tech Stack:**
    * **Frontend:** React.js
    * **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
    * **Database:** PostgreSQL (using Prisma as an ORM) or MongoDB (using Mongoose)
    * **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend) & Render (Backend)

### 7. Major Challenges & Risks

1.  **The "Chicken-or-the-Egg" Problem:** We need listings to attract buyers, but we need buyers to attract sellers.
    * **Plan:** We'll solve this by having our team and our close friends pre-populate the site with 20-30 real listings *before* we launch.

2.  **Payment & Dispute Liability:** By handling payments, we take on new risks.
    * **Plan:** We will implement a "Platform Fee" (e.g., 2-5%) to cover costs. We will have a **clear, "no-return" policy** mandated by the platform. Our Terms of Service will state:
        * The seller's identity is *verified* by us (.edu email) but *hidden* from the public until campus meet.
        * All transactions are an agreement between the buyer and seller.
        * Buyers are *required* to inspect the product in person during their campus meetup with seller.
        * Once the exchange is made, the sale is final.
        * We will clearly state that *we are not responsible for returns or disputes*; sellers may offer returns, but that is a private agreement.

3.  **User Safety (In-Person Meetups):** Facilitating meetups still carries risk.
    * **Plan:** We'll have clear "Safety Guidelines" and strongly suggest "Safe Exchange Zones" on campus (e.g., the library lobby, near campus security).

4.  **Ghost Town Risk:** What if people sign up once and never come back?
    * **Plan:** We need a small, dedicated marketing push at the start of each semester (when people are buying/selling most) to remind them we exist.

### 8. Expected Outcomes & Impact

* **Short-Term Success (First Month):**
    * 150+ verified user signups.
    * 75+ active listings on the platform.
    * Our project is the talk of the college's social media.

* **Long-Term Impact:**
    * Become the *default* platform for student-to-student commerce on campus.
    * **Promote Sustainability:** Encourage a "reuse" culture instead of a "throw-away" one at the end of every year.
    * Save students (collectively) thousands of dollars.

### 9. Next Steps

1.  **(This Week):** Finalize this document and commit to our MVP feature list.
2.  **Task 1 (Lead):** Set up the **GitHub repository** and a **project board** (e.g., GitHub Projects/Issues) for task management.
3.  **Task 2 (UI/UX):** Start wireframing the 6 key screens (Home, Login, Browse, Single Item, Post Item, Payment Flow) screen.
4.  **Task 3 (Backend):** Initialize the Node.js project and design the database schema for `Users`,`Listings(items)` and `Payments`.
